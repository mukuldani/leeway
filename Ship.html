        <p class="ship-text">The shipping and logistics industry has experienced the advantages of adopting Business Process 
        Outsourcing (BPO) as a strategy to improve efficiencies and reduce the cost of operations.</p>

        <p class="ship-text"><b>LEEWAY Solutions for Freight Carriers</b></p>

        <p class="ship-text">Economic volatility, rising fuel costs and fluctuating industry cycles are impacting the growth and profitability of shipping and logistics 
        companies. As a result, leading players are increasingly turning to Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) as a strategy to improve the efficiency of business processes, 
        while significantly reducing the cost of operations.</p>

        Rail and Contract Logistics. Its extensive experience of delivering outsourcing solutions to industry leaders, deep domain expertise and operational excellence 
        enable companies in this sector to focus on their core business, while LEEWAY takes care of their business processes.</p>

        <p class="ship-text">LEEWAY's service offerings are customized for companies in the following sectors:</p>

        <ul class="ship-points-text" style="list-style-type:initial;">
            
            <li><b><u>Logistics Services Outsourcing - Ocean Shipping Industry: </u></b>
            <p>The shipping and logistics industry bears the hallmarks of a cyclical industry viz, periodically alternating demand-supply patterns causing severe demand-supply 
            mismatches and the consequent gyrations in the top line and bottom line performance. The deeply fragmented nature of this industry, at a global level, further exacerbates 
            the situation and acts as a natural barrier to calibrate the supply side dynamics to match the existing demand. This situation is now slowly changing, and consolidation is 
            emerging as a survival strategy in the container shipping industry. Companies are now looking at leveraging the benefits of partnering with an outsourcing provider.</p>
            <p>The LEEWAY shipping and logistics vertical offers industry focused service offerings and solutions which help companies in this crucial sector of the economy leverage 
                the strategic advantages of outsourcing and become more competitive. The LEEWAY shipping and logistics vertical has domain and outsourcing experts who identify industry 
                pain-points and design appropriate outsourcing services and solutions in a holistic manner.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b><u>Logistics Services Outsourcing - Air (Express) Industry :</u></b>
             <p>The air express industry has been affected by the recent global economic downturn and rising fuel costs. Apart from facing pressures from environmental groups and statutory 
                bodies to reduce air pollution due to its impact on global warming, these companies also have to cope with the volume reduction as a result of low cost transport options like
                road and ocean shipping. To counter these trends, companies in the air express sector have tied up with outsourcing companies to reduce their operating costs and improve service 
                delivery capabilities.</p>
            <p>LEEWAY has the right credentials and experience  with the right resources with rich domain knowledge to perform business processes that span across the entire business value chain in the air express sector.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b><u>Logistics Services Outsourcing - Road (Trucking) Industry: </u></b>
             <p>The trucking industry is characterized by low entry barriers and a commoditized nature of services, and this has led to a fragmented and competitive market. The rising cost of 
                motor fuel has made a significant dent in the operating margins of companies in the trucking sector. Progressive players in this sector are eager to look for opportunities to 
                move up the value chain and create customer stickiness by improving their service delivery. At the same time, they are looking to aggressively cut servicing costs since this 
                industry is known to operate on slender operating margins. Trucking companies are working with outsourcing partners to meet these goals.</p>
            <p>LEEWAY has gained deep domain knowledge of this sector and provides a bouquet of service offerings designed to help companies in the trucking sector achieve their financial and service 
                delivery objectives.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b><u>Logistics Services Outsourcing - Rail Industry: </u></b>
              <p>Companies in the freight railroad sector enjoy competitive advantage for being cheaper and more fuel-efficient than truck and ship transport. However, there exists scope for freight
                 rail operators to further improve their operating margins. Freight railroad companies also need to recoup the significant capital investments they have made over the years to improve 
                service reliability and generate an effective return on investment</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p class="ship-text"><b>Logistics Service Providers:</b></p>
        <p class="ship-text">These complement and integrate the Freight Carriers with end-to-end client solutions. A sub-segment here is the logistics and supply chain solution companies.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="ship-text"><b>LEEWAY Solutions for Logistic Service Providers</b></p>
        <p class="ship-text">The supply chain solution side of the industry works as an integrator to the end client. Non-vessel-owning common carriers (NVOCCS), global forwarding companies, 
        third-party logistics players and fourth-party logistics players are now seeking competitive advantages in the marketplace through business process outsourcing</p>

        <p class="ship-text">The key advantages of the LEEWAY outsourced model are: </p>

        <ul class="ship-points-text" style="list-style-type:initial;">
            <li>It enables smooth access to newer markets by product development and global presence.</li>
            <li>It improves margins by providing variable transactional costs, service delivery excellence through a 24/7 contact center, risk mitigation by reducing entry costs to newer markets and enabling better process control.</li>
            <li>LEEWAY has domain expertise to customize warehousing, transportation and other logistic solutions on demand. LEEWAY helps create virtual, scalable layers which can act as an engine for your business growth.</li>
