        <p class="rural-head">Rural BPO</p>

        <p class="rural-text">Our foray into Rural BPO outsourcing services is a niche service offering with our bold statement to achieve 
        the following through our unique and structured delivery model :</p>

        <ul class="rural-main-pts">
            <li>Target 30-40% operational cost savings.</li>
            <li>Quick turnaround of projects.</li>
            <li>Expert services of data processing professionals.</li>
            <li>Risk free outsourcing experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="rural-text">Business Process Outsourcing is a great example of globalization. Work like capital is today flowing freely to 
        places where it gets best value. If the same is true in rural context where the workforce is more consistent, hungry and relatively 
        cheaper, Indian villages can reap rewards of IT boom in cities. Unfortunately, while the solution looks attractive on paper, we still 
        have to counter some critical challenges to emerge a winner. Most importantly, we need to offset the benefits of a dense cluster as in 
        cities with better controlling and merging tools in villages. Concerns on capacity in a decentralised environment, data security and 
        overall quality control needs to be answered. A strong business case based on social and commercial returns coupled with appropriate 
        technological intervention has the capability of transforming the rural landscape.</p>

        <p class="rural-text">Our hybrid-model is a source of relatively low cost, customer-centric, quality focused and socially responsible 
        business process outsourcing that provides meaningful livelihood to educated people of rural & semi-urban India.</p>

        <p class="rural-text">As the Indian domestic market expands to semi-urban and rural markets, we are able to offer prospective clients a cost effective and 
        culturally specific back-end platform to service customers.</p>

        <p class="rural-text">For this reason, our holistic approach to business generates and will continue to generate financial and social returns for all of our stakeholders.</p>
